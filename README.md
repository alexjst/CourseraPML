# CourseraPML
To the graders:

This is the .rmd and .html submission repo for Coursera PML Class project assignment.

Some notes:

1. It is easier to read this HTML page: http://alexjst.github.io/CourseraPML/PML_Project_HAR.html
2. If you download the .rmd file, please note that I am using load() function to load the model that I previously saved (with save() function) from the console. This way, I was able to avoid repeatedly computing the model each time I was "knitting" the HTML file from R studio.

Thank you!

Alex
